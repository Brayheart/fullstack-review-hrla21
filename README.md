# Fullstack Review HRLA21
Fullstack review prior to TA for HRLA21

## Project Overview
This project will load a list of basketball players, all San Antonio Spurs, to
a Mongo database. Users can submit a basketball player that will post to
database and then dynamically render for the list view. The end goal is to
implement a fullstack application based on the images in `assets`
